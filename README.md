In the home page user can select last day's, week's and month's trend reposotories. Reposotories are shown in recycler. In layout there are reposotory's name, reposotory owner's name and profile image, reposotory's star 
count and description. For asthetic descriptions limited with 200 characters. For optimization user sees 30 reposotries. When user scrolls last element 30 more reposotory are loading. When click reposotory user can see same
info and reposotry's language, fork count, creation date and link to github page. When click link app redirects to github page on default browser. User can also see full description in this page. Users can add reposotory to
their favorites and delete by clicking heart icon in details page. Users can look their favorites clicking favorite icon in home page. In favorites page there is recycler view with same design as home's recycler. I did not
implement feature that user can add reposotory to their favorites from home page.
